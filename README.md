# LeetCode Problems Repository

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems, organized by topic. The goal is to document a structured approach in the pursuit of mastering data structures and algorithms, which form the foundation of computer science and software development.

LeetCode problems are an excellent way to:
- **Ingrain Core Concepts**: Deepen your understanding of essential data structures (arrays, linked lists, hash tables, trees, graphs, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.).
- **Build Problem-Solving Fluency**: Develop the analytical skills required to approach complex problems with confidence and efficiency.
- **Prepare for Success**: Fluency in solving algorithmic problems sets you up for success across all areas of software development, from systems design to front-end and back-end programming.

Whether one is a student, a developer preparing for coding interviews, or someone passionate about improving problem-solving skills, this repository serves as a valuable resource to guide in the journey.

## Contents
- **Problem Categories**: Solutions are grouped by topics such as Arrays, Hashing, Graphs, Linked Lists and more.
- **Explanations**: Each problem includes a description of the requirements, explanation of the approach and complexity analysis.
- **Learning Goals**: The repository is designed for ongoing practice and to serve as future reference.
