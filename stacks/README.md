## Overview of Stack Data Structure

### Stack
A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It is analogous to a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top.

- **Strengths**:
  - Simple and efficient for scenarios requiring LIFO access.
  - Operations like **push** (insertion) and **pop** (removal) are performed in constant time (`O(1)`).
  - Provides a clean mechanism for managing nested operations, such as recursion or parenthesis matching.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Limited access to elements; only the top of the stack can be accessed.
  - Not suitable for problems requiring random or sequential access to all elements.

### Key Operations
1. **Push**: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Retrieves the element at the top without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Checks if the stack is empty.

### Variations of Stack
- **Array-Based Stack**:
  - Implemented using an array.
  - Fixed size unless resized dynamically.
- **Linked List-Based Stack**:
  - Implemented using nodes linked to each other.
  - Dynamic size, growing or shrinking as elements are added or removed.

## Why Use Stacks?

Stacks are versatile and integral in solving problems involving nested or ordered operations:

1. **Recursive Problems**:
   - Used to manage function calls and backtracking in recursion.
2. **Expression Evaluation**:
   - Useful for parsing mathematical expressions, matching parentheses, and converting between infix, prefix, and postfix notations.
3. **Undo/Redo Mechanisms**:
   - Commonly used in software applications to track changes for undo/redo operations.
