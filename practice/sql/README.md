# Database Querying, Design/Modelling and Management

## Structured Query Language (SQL)

A standardized and declarative programming language designed for interacting with relational databases.

## Core Purpose

SQL allows users to create, retrieve, update, delete and aggregate recrods (rows) from a structured relational database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server which store data in tables with rows and columns.

## Key Components

SQL is divided into several distinct command categories:

- **Data Query Language (DQL):** Extracts data using SELECT statements

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Modifies data using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands

- **Data Definition Language (DDL):** Defines database structure using CREATE, ALTER and DROP statements
