# Overview of Two Pointer Approach

## Core Concept

The Two Pointer technique is a versatile strategy for solving array and string problems efficiently. It involves maintaining two indices (pointers) that traverse the data structure, often from opposite ends or at different speeds. By moving the pointers based on problem-specific conditions, we can optimize for O(n) time complexity and reduce unnecessary iterations, making it ideal for problems like finding pairs, reversing, or partitioning.
