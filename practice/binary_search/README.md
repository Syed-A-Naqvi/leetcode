# Overview of Binary Search Algorithms

## Core Concept

Binary search algorithms follow the more general *divide and conquer* principle where we divide the problem space into more manageable chunks.
In the case of binary search, we attempt to discard roughly half the problem space each iteration, resulting in very fast O($\log_2(n)$) time solutions.
