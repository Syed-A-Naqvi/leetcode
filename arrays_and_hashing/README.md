## Overview of Array and Hash Table Data Structures

### Arrays
An **array** is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow for efficient access to elements via indexing, making them a fundamental data structure in computer science.

- **Strengths**:
  - Constant-time (`O(1)`) access for elements by index.
  - Suitable for problems that require sequential or positional storage.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - Fixed size in many implementations, requiring resizing for dynamic storage.
  - Insertion and deletion (except at the end) can be costly (`O(n)`).

### Hash Maps and Hash Sets
A **hash map** (or dictionary) is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hashing function. A **hash set** is a simplified version that stores unique elements without key-value pairs.

- **Hash Map**:
  - Stores key-value pairs.
  - Provides average constant-time (`O(1)`) operations for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

- **Hash Set**:
  - Ensures uniqueness of elements.
  - Provides fast membership checks and insertion.

## Why Use Arrays and Hashing?

Arrays and hashing are complementary tools in solving problems efficiently:

1. **Arrays** provide a straightforward way to store ordered data and iterate over it.
2. **Hashing** allows for quick lookups, avoiding the need to search through the entire data set.
